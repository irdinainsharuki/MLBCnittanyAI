# Machine Learning Bootcamp (MLB) - Nittany AI @ Penn State
As part of the Nittany AI Machine Learning Bootcamp at Penn State, I’m engaging in an immersive learning experience structured into four key areas of AI over the course of the semester:
1. Building a Model to Classify Flowers (White Box Model) : Understanding and building interpretable machine learning models such as linear regression, decision trees, and random forests.
2. MNIST Classification with Tensorflow (Neural Networks):  Gaining hands-on experience with neural networks, including developing projects like digit classification (MNIST) and more complex tasks like image classification with convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
3. Fine-tuning a Stable Diffusion Model (Fine Tuning) : Exploring the power of transfer learning and fine-tuning pre-trained models, which allows for quicker, more effective model development in tasks like image classification or large language model applications.
4. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Combining retrieval mechanisms with generative models for tasks like question answering and document analysis, using techniques such as word embeddings and cosine similarity to build practical, industry-relevant AI solutions.

Through these projects, I’ve developed skills in building machine learning models from scratch, using state-of-the-art frameworks, and working on practical AI applications. Each project allows me to explore real-world use cases, from real estate prediction using AI to fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for specific tasks.
